dbtc: David's Bitcoin Tool Chest
----

These are some Ruby scripts I have been working on to do useful stuff with
Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, such as extracting data from wallet
files and converting between different Bitcoin address formats.

Sometimes it is hard to find wallet software that supports all of the
conversions I want to do, especially when you consider all the Bitcoin
forks that have happened, and all the different wallet formats that are out
there.  So I write my own, simple code to do that stuff.

This project is not really ready to be used by other people yet.
